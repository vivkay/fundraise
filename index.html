            <h1>The Fundraising Goal</h1>
            <h4>To raise <b>$1500</b> by 10 September 2015, to support children living with physical disabilities.</h4>
            <p>I'm fundraising as part of the annual Easter Seals Drop Zone event; an initiative that's about pushing the boundaries of your comfort zone for a greater cause (BooYah!)</p>
            <p>With your help, that is if I reach the $1500 fundraising target, I will face my fear of heights and rappel off a 20-storey building in downtown Ottawa – and I'll do it dressed as a superhero! All funds raised will go to the Easter Seals.</p>

          <h1>The <span class="color-change">Super Awesome</span> Cause</h1>
          <p>For over 85 years, Easter Seals, a registered charity, has been dedicated to serving Canadians with disabilities, striving to ensure that no one is left behind. Some things you might like to know:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="giga">More than 100,000 Canadians and their families annually access programs and services provided by Easter Seals organizations across Canada.</li>
              <li class="giga">Easter Seals provides summer camps and active living programs for children living with physical disabilities, as well as specialized mobility equipment.</li>
              <li class="giga">Every summer, more than 6,000 kids attend one of Easter Seals' fully accessible summer camps (just think of all those fun times and smiles).</li>
            </ul>
          <p>At their fully accessible camps, kids and youth learn about themselves and the potential of their abilities. They are asked to get out of their comfort zones to overcome fears and try new things. At the Drop Zone event I'll be following this same idea – pushing my own limits in support of something greater than myself.</p>
